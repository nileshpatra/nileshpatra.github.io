This article offers a wide overview of how the year went, what I did and how I felt overall about it. Starting with things that matter most.

## Debian

### Techincal Contributions

Debian has been a big part of my life ever since 2019. I tried to make as much time as possible for Debian this year as well,
mostly in form of contributions. I did a few new packages for [gomuks](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gomuks) being an interesting one and also took over the maintenance of [kitty](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/kitty).
Along with this, I sponsored a bunch of packages, reviewed MRs and pushed commits
to [lintian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/lintian) and did some mentoring.

Comparing the salsa activity graph of past years, my activity, very clearly dwindled a bit.

![Salsa 2022 Contributions](/2022-salsa.png "Salsa 2022 Contributions")
![Salsa 2023 Contributions](/2023-salsa.png "Salsa 2023 Contributions")

This was mostly due to me becoming busier with real life activities and day job becoming more hectic. Nevertheless, I am happy with
whatever I could contribute.

### AM'ing for DD applications

I have been an application manager since August 2022. This means I "interview" upcoming [Debian Developers](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper), guiding them through the [NM process](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper/JoinTheProject/NewMember#Step_5:_The_Application_Manager).
This year I processed and approved 5 applications and processing one application at the moment which is ongoing.

### Mentoring and Outreach

I was formally [delegated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2023/11/msg00004.html) as a member of the [Debian Outreach Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Outreach).
This started with me asking [Abhijith](https://abhijithpa.me/) if I could help to coordinate Google Summer of Code activities within Debian and the rest of the process was done very quickly post that.

I am also mentoring in this [Outreachy December 23 Round](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2023-12/) for the first time with [Israel](https://komolehin.dreamwidth.org/) being my mentee. This is a different experience, with tons of "mentor" assignments and some nice
mentoring pointers from the Outreachy Organizers. It seems they are doing a really good job with the Organizational bits.

## Conferences

### IndiaFoss 2023

[IndiaFoss 2023](https://indiafoss.net/2023) took place on October 28-29. I travelled to Bangalore after a long, long time.
This was a fun conference with me seeing many familiar people, meeting new people with similar interests and attending some
fun talks in the process.

Ofcourse, I met my GSoC'20 gang after more than 3 long years for the first time, while keeping in very regular touch throughout!

### Debconf'23

I attended [Debconf'23](https://debconf23.debconf.org/) that happened from September 10 to 17 in [Kochi, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi).
This was an entirely new experience with meeting lots of new and old folks, many of whom I had been working for
years but never got a chance to meet. Those nicks that I would see popping up from time to time on IRC now have faces!

<< IMAGE >>

This meant a week full of relaxation, attending workshops and talks, working on Debian, having a casual chat, having meals
with interesting people and ofcourse, roaming around in Kochi ðŸ˜€

This was an enjoyable experience and would definitely attend the next edition in 2024 which is
set to happen in Busan, South Korea.

### MiniDebconf, Villupuram

[MDC Villupuram](https://tn23.mini.debconf.org/) happened from January 28 to 29 this year. This gave me an opportunity to visit
[Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai) and eventually VPM. Although a short event, it was nice to meet familiar people.

<< IMAGE >>

As an addendum, I gave myself an opportunity (ðŸ˜œ) to visit [Puducherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry) which was
a very enjoyable experience with serene beaches all around. This is a place that I'd definitely want to give a visit again!

## Abhraham Raji

This deserves a blog post of its own. The most tragic incident of this year was loss of a dear friend, Abraham Raji
in a [tragic accident](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230914).

<< IMAGE >>

I have known Abraham since 2019 and saw him as a very active contributor since then, helping and popping into
different channels. I will always remember that smile which would instantly light up the room.

<< IMAGE >>

Web Development, Graphic Designing, Mentoring, Debian Development - this man left no skill untouched. I was always
impressed by the sheer amount of things he was doing and it will always serve as an inspiration for me. And ofcourse, Abraham's
[Debian Packaging Guide](https://wiki.abrahamraji.in/simple-packaging-tutorial.html) is a goto place for newcomers to look into.

Maybe I should've expressed that even I *too* use these series of immensely helpful tutorials from time to time when I need
to re-create my environment.
I was also very impressed by the depth of thoughts Abraham had and would read [his blog](https://abrahamraji.in/post/) from
time to time. One heck of a talented man, indeed!

Needless to say, I miss him greatly. Au revoir my friend, see you in another life - or later in this one!

## New Skills

This year had been rather slow with respect to learning new things. The day job and Debian activities would consume most part
of my day leaving little time for any extra learning. Nevertheless, I studied Networking, probably did this properly for the
first time after college, picked up some Cloud Engineering, learnt a bit of Reverse Engineering and CyberSecurity stuff.

This may sound like a lot, but I actually did only bits of most of these ðŸ˜•
I intend to change this in the coming year and spend some more time on *myself* and *new skills*.

Besides, I also learnt some new stuff at dayjob being put into multiple projects and then given different (optimization)
tasks in between the projects.

## Conclusion

Overall, I did a bunch of travel, met new (and old) folks and got some cool stuff done. I and my loved ones have been
in fine health throughout for which I am greatful to the Almighty. This was a fine year overall; I however do look forward an
even better 2024.
